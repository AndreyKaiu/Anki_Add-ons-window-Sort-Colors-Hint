# Anki_Add-ons-window-Sort-Colors-Hint
Add-on for the Anki program. For the window with add-ons, it implements the ability to sort and color the list, it is possible to set a hint for a specific add-on.

All this functionality simplifies working with add-ons, since you can highlight important ones with color, you can set a hint after the name or a hint before the name (group name). Sorting allows you to see which add-ons are newer (older) or with which add-on we recently changed the setting (changing the color, hint does not change the date of the meta.json file, although it stores this information there).
