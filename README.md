After pressing the "Restore Defaults" button, 2 buttons may be displayed allowing you to quickly move to the line highlighted in red. This is how duplicate lines are shown if the user has previously changed something to suit his preferences and he is now given the opportunity to delete the extra lower (new) line if he needs to leave the value as it was before.

All this functionality simplifies working with add-ons, since you can highlight important ones with color, you can set a hint after the name or a hint before the name (group name). Sorting allows you to see which add-ons are newer (older) or with which add-on we recently changed the setting (changing the color, hint does not change the date of the meta.json file, although it stores this information there).
